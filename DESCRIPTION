Description: Protein domains is one of the most import annoation of proteins we have
    with the Pfam database/tool being (by far) the most used tool. This R package enables
    the user to read the pfam prediction from both webserver and stand-alone runs into R.
    We have recently shown most human protein domains exist as multiple distinct variants 
    termed domain isotypes. Different domain isotypes are used in a cell, tissue, and 
    disease-specific manner. Accordingly, we find that domain isotypes, compared to each other,
    modulate, or abolish the functionality of a protein domain. This R package enables the
    identification and classification of such domain isotypes from Pfam data.
